# Mind Map Prototype

I like making mindmaps, but haven't found a solution on the computer that is as dynamic as I would like

I am using this processing sketch to iterate on some ideas I had and see if they hold water.

## How To Use

Not worth writing down yet, but come back in the future!

## How to Build / Run

The easiest option is to just use the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download/). Or you can use the commandline tool:

```
cd mind_map_prototype
processing-java --force --output /tmp/MindMapSketch --input=$(pwd)/MindMap --run
```
